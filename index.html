		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What’s long and brings me pleasure? The bass; I’ve been playing it for over a year now, and I can’t tell why I picked the bass over the guitar. Maybe it’s because I like to be different for the sake of being different. Maybe it's because I am not yet equipped for all the overdoses that come with being a lead guitarist or singer. Who knows? But I can say for sure that it has changed my life for the better. </p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first thing that bass taught me is that no matter how good you think you are, you still suck. There’s always room for improvement no matter how good or bad you are. Recently I was playing a song that I was learning and thought to myself: “Damn, all you have to do is pluck a note or two and you can play a song? I’m really good at this!”. This all changed after I started recording myself playing. Not only is my rhythm questionable, the way I articulate the notes is unclear, and my distortion tone sounds like a protein fart. It is important to have a mentor in any sense, so you can get valuable feedback. Objective feedback is critical, be it in how you train for a sport, how you do your philosophy homework, or how you code. Otherwise, you might delude yourself into thinking that you’re better than you actually are. </p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second thing that bass taught me is that being simple is powerful. Some of the best songs that I actively listen to, have the bass come in when you least expect it, and blend into the background for most of the song until when it comes again. And when it does, it shakes you. This is applicable to my daily life. People always say I talk too much and ask unnecessary questions. And to more of an extent than I like to admit, they’re not wrong. When I go to lift, I complain that it's heavy. When I try to do my homework, I like to complain about how this doesn’t apply to my daily life, and that the world should appreciate me for the weenie I am. But, when I am mindful of controlling my mental dialogue, when I talk intermittently and occasionally, people seem to appreciate me more. It feels paradoxical. And it’s hard to do, because I love to talk. But scarcity creates value.</p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The last thing that bass has taught me is that you don’t have to be perfect. My favorite band’s bassist, Randy Armstrong from Red, has tones that I can’t seem to emulate given my equipment. Even if I had the same equipment I probably wouldn’t be able to emulate the same tone. Bass playing is his livelihood, and he’s probably forgotten more about bass than I know. It’s similar to the way I will never be as good of a weightlifter as Szymon Kolecki when he was 15. Or write like Margaret Atwood. I’m a wannabe in all of these domains.</p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But that’s okay. </p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am uniquely me, and I can only do activities the way my circumstances let me. </p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So may as well do something, right? Doing something you like poorly is better than doing nothing at all. The person shooting heroin on the subway doesn’t care about whether I slap like Victor Wooten or not, so why should I? Like him, I want to enjoy life’s pleasures. Like playing an instrument.</p>
		<br>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So just play an instrument. You might even write a blog post about it one day ;)</p>
